# 🛋️ RoomCraft – Game of Teens

**RoomCraft** is a web project created as part of the **Game of Teens 2025** initiative. It is a stylish and responsive website that allows users to plan the interior of a room in an interactive format.
The project was created by Mykola Sadlii.

## 🥁 Results

🎉 **RoomCraft** took **5th place** among **12 participants** in the **Frontend** direction at the **Game of Teens 2025** hackathon!

🚀 This was my **first hackathon** — and immediately got into the **top 5**!

💻 It was difficult, but very interesting. I improved in HTML, CSS, JS, responsive layout and the ability to quickly solve problems under deadline pressure.

🔥 This experience gave me even more motivation to develop further.

👉 Ahead — even cooler projects!
